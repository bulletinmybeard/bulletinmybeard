# Hey there! I'm Robin

I'm a full-stack software engineer passionate about building practical tools and exploring innovative solutions. My work ranges from system utilities to developer productivity tools, with a focus on Python, DevOps, observability, and AI-powered applications.

## What I'm Working On

Currently focused on developer tools, automation, and AI integration in enterprise environments. At work, I develop solutions in the Salesforce ecosystem using Apex, SOQL, and Lightning Web Components. In my personal projects, I explore AI technologies including OpenAI, Claude, Ollama, and local LLMs to create intelligent automation tools and enhance developer workflows.

## Technical Stack

**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Apex, SOQL, Shell/Bash, Lua  
**AI & ML:** OpenAI API, Claude, Ollama, LangChain, local LLMs (Llama, DeepSeek, Mistral)  
**Infrastructure:** Docker, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, OpenResty  
**Platforms:** Salesforce (Apex, Lightning), macOS development, Obsidian plugin development  
**Interests:** AI/LLM integration, developer tools, system automation, observability, API integrations
